7. From the lab environment, launch a remote desktop session to have access to the Ubuntu Desktop. 

You can test the application service by opening Google Chrome browser on the **Ubuntu Jumphost** and type the URL ``https://10.1.10.126``.

Notice the new certificate is now being used by the browser.

.. note:: The certificate shows not secure as we are using a demo Root CA not imported in the browser by default.
